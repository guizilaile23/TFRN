Code and data of paper: A texture feature removal network for sonar image classification and detection


because the upload files must <25M, so i upload the source code on Baidu Netdisk.

extract code (提取码)：w4mw 

and a few note:
1, i'm so sorry that i have forgotten the detail of this code, but i make lots of #note

2、I remember the single_convert.py is used to debug the algorithm.

3, if the debug results seems fine, then i will use batch_convert.py to generate the whitened dataset, then train a NN under the whitened dataset, and at the same time, train a NN with original dataset, so that my algorithm could be compared.

4, finally, start with single_convert.py is recommended
